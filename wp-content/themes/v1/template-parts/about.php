    <h4>Hello there!</h4>

        <p>My goal is to always write modern, performant, maintainable code for websites and applications that matches the design pixel by pixel.</p>
        <p>Most recently, I’ve built a custom PR site–Little Star PR–and an e-commerce platform–Ilmor Store–with the good folks at Electric Fun, a boutique creative agency in Toledo, Ohio.</p>
        <p>Outside of work I enjoy learning about new technology, dabbling in design, writing and recording music, and playing golf.</p>
