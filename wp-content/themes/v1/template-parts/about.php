      <p>Hi there! My name is Matt and specialize in building exceptional websites. </p>
      <p>It's my mission to create pixel-perfect and peformant products for my clients. Most recently, Iâ€™ve been fortunate to work with the good folks at Electric Fun, a boutique creative agency in Toledo, Ohio. I'm currently available for hire. </p>
      <p>Outside of work I enjoy learning about new technology, writing and recording music, running, and playing golf.</p>
